<p style="border:red; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">On this page of the ePortfolio you will find more info 
about what the work was about on unit 13. What this unit was about was that we had to make a website titled moblie
world station and it was to help that company to promote mobile phones, accessories and services and the website 
was to target anyone who was interested in buying a mobile phone for the first time. The reason for why I have
included this unit in my ePortfolio is because it was one of the main units that we needed to complete to finish
this course and also because I believe whoever views this ePortfolio and see's this info about this unit and they
have an interest in developing websites then they can read this page and the other page about unit 13 and they can
learn all about from there.</p>
