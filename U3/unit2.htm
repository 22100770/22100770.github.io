<p style="border:red; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">On this page of the Eportfolio I will be discussing 
the work that I did on unit 2 while on this course and what I learnt from this unit. This page will be about unit 2 
and what work was done on this Unit and the work that was done on this unit was that we had to learn about 
technology systems and some of that work involved us in doing certain activity sheets where we would learn about 
technology systems. Some of the work that we had to do included doing a sample test so that we knew what we were 
doing.</p>

that I did to help me revise for the unit 2 online assignment and some of the work that was done was mainly revision
for the second online assignment which is one of the things that we need to complete if we are to do level 3 IT.</p>
