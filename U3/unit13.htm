discussing the work that I did on unit 13 while on this course and what I learnt from this unit while on this course.
This page will be about unit 13 and the work that I did on this unit and the work that I did on this unit included 
planning and deveoping a website for a company called Mobile World Station and with this assignment we had a certain 
amount of time to plan for this assignment and the amount that we had to plan for this assignment was 1 week and we
had 4 weeks to develop the website and test the website to see if everything worked on it. The things that I have
learnt from this unit is how to design, devleop and test a website. One of the things that we had to do after we
had finished the website was that we had to review the website and that include explaining what we had done and what
changes we had made to website that weren't on the plan.</p>
