<p style="border:red; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">On this page of the ePorfolio you will find out more
info about unit 8. what this unit was about was that we had to create a mobile app for the alpahbet to help 
children to learn the alphabet. The reason why I have included this unit in my ePortfolio is because it was one of 
the main units that was needed to complete to finish this course and to move on to level 3 and also because I 
believe whoever views this ePortfolio and see's this info about this unit and they have an interest in developing 
moblie apps then they can read this page and the other page about unit 13 and they can learn all about from there.
