<p style="border:red; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">On this page of the Eportfolio I will be discussing 
the work that I did on unit 15 while on this course and what I learnt from this unit. This page will be about unit 15 
and the work that I did on this unit and the work that I did on this unit included going into the system of a 
desktop and a laptop to see what the processor speed was on the desktop and the laptop and to also see what the 
storage capicity was on the desktop and the laptop. We also did work to find out what the software recommendations 
were for certain pieces of software like Ubuntu, Firefox web browser, Windows 11 home and we found this info out 
for both the desktop and the laptop. What I learnt from this unit was how to check for certain things on a desktop
and a laptop.</p>

<p style="border:green; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">On the image to the right it shows some of the work
that I did on this unit to help me complete this unit and what I had to do for this piece of work was that I had
to find out certain things about the laptop and then type them into system specification log and one of the things
that I had to find out was that I had to find out what the processor speed was like on the laptop.</p>
