<p style="border:red; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">On this page I will be discussing the work that I did 
on unit 8 while on this course and what I learnt from thisunit. This page will be about unit 8 and what unit work 
was done on unit 8 and the work that was done on unit 8 was that we had to plan and develop and app about the 
alphabet and we did that by using a piece of software called MIT app inventor and this software helps us delevop 
the app that we needed to make about the alphabet. We had a week to plan our design for how the app was going to 
look and we had 3 weeks to develop the app and test the app and then review the app that we had made. The skills 
that I have learnt from this unit is how to develop and test a mobile app.</p>

<p style="border:green; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">This image on the right is one of the storyboard 
plans that I had to make for the app and we had to try and make the app look like the storyboard plan but we were 
also allowed to make some changes to the app that weren't on the plan and I actually made a few changes on some of 
the pages for the app that weren't on the plan.</p>

<b>
<p style="border:green; border-width:5px; border-style:solid;">This image to the left is the first page of the 
mobile app that I made using MIT app inventor and like I said earlier I made a few changes to the actual page that 
weren't on the plan and one of those changes was that I made the image that it is in the center of the page a bit 
wider so that the user could see much better.</p>
