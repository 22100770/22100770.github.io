<p>With the iPhone its phone stand offers many things like it can be used as a desktop stand as well as a phone 
stand and since it can be used as stand for your desktop that means it can provide a stable base for your iPhone and 
it can support your charging for when your phone needs charging up but the stand is only compatible with certain 
iPhone models. Another feature that the stand for the desktop has is that it has third party stands and that means
that many third party manufacturers can offer desktop stands that have adjustable angles with it and that allows
you to use your iPhone while it is charging. The phone stand for the iPhone also can be adjusted and that means that
you can adjust the stand to your own way to suit you so say for instance that you are watching a video on your phone 
and you want to adjust you stand so you can see the video clearly then all you need to do is to tilt or turn the stand
to the way that you like it. Also the other thing that the stand has to offer is that you can have wireless charging 
with the stand so when ever you need to charge up your phone then all you need to do is to insert the phone into
the stand and then your phone will start to charge up.</p>
